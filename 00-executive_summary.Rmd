<!-- **SHORT-TERM RENTALS IN PRINCE EDWARD COUNTY: MARKET OVERVIEW** -->

<!-- - There are on a daily average 490 active STA listings in Prince Edward County housing units in 2021, which collectively earned $138,000 per day. -->
<!-- - The average number of active listings declined by 37.2% compared to 2019, while revenue increased by 52.7%. -->
<!-- - The ward with the most active listings is Picton, with 19.5%, followed by Hallowell (13.4%) and Wellington (11.5%). -->
<!-- - Most (92.9%) STA listings were entire homes, responsible for 98.0% of total revenues. -->
<!-- - Revenue is distributed unevenly among hosts, with the top 10% of hosts earning 49.2% of revenues and the top 1% earning 20.8% of all revenues. -->
<!-- - Multilistings account for almost half (49.6%) of STA listings in the county, earning 50.6% of total host revenue. -->
<!-- - The Covid-19 pandemic has caused reservations to drop by 20%, while nightly prices were almost twice (48.4%) as high in 2021 compared to 2019. -->
<!-- - The pandemic has also flattened the seasonality pattern in the county, with non-summer months receiving more reservations on average than the years before. -->

<!-- **STA HOUSING MARKET IMPACTS** -->

<!-- - Housing prices and sales volumes have accelerated significantly since the start of the pandemic, from 460 properties sold in 2019 to an expected 1,110 by the end of 2021. -->
<!-- - While prices were rising prior to 2020, the data suggest that price growth was beginning to level off until the pandemic introduced a massive demand shock to the housing market (average prices in December 2020 were 87.1% higher than in December 2019). -->
<!-- - In 2020, the average sale price in Prince Edward County was $625,080, only to rise to $754,930 in 2021. -->
<!-- - In five wards, households would require an additional $50,000 or more in annual income to be able to afford being a homeowner in the County. -->
<!-- - In 2021, 7.5% of property sales were for houses that were sold two years before or less. -->
<!-- - Rents rose 52% between June 2020 and June 2021, rises due to an increase in demand without a corresponding increase in supply. -->
<!-- - Prior to the pandemic, 5.8% of Prince Edward County housing units operated as dedicated STA in the summer. -->
<!-- - The number of dedicated STAs declined during the pandemic, but the supply seems to have returned to pre-pandemic levels during the summer of 2021.  -->
<!-- - About half of all housing sales in 2016 and 2017 can be attributed to new STAs, but that share has halved in recent years. -->

<!-- **REGISTRATION ANALYSIS** -->

<!-- - Out of the 963 license applications, 423 were approved, with  total of 351 valid licenses operating prior the the moratorium. -->
<!-- - Picton is the ward that received the most license applications, with 71, followed by Hallowell (60) and Wellington (54). -->
<!-- - During the STA registration period, there was about 1 new STR listing created per day. During the moratorium, the rate of new listings being created on STR platforms remained substantially the same, showing that the registration and moratorium did not directly impact the creation of STA listings in the county, but rather the overall pandemic conditions. -->
<!-- - 331 housing units that were sold since 2016 also applied for a STA license, indicating a strong connection between recent house sales and STR operations. -->


<!-- **MOVING FORWARD: SHORT-TERM ACCOMMODATION REGULATION PATHWAYS IN PRINCE EDWARD COUNTY ** -->

<!-- - Based on the registration analysis, there are two policy pathways that the county could take to reinstate the STA registration system: Redistribute or Restrict; which could be done for towns and village only or for the entire county. -->
<!-- - By redistributing, the county would emit licenses to primary residence operators only, having the potential to redistribute $6.2 million in STA revenue to 1,000 part-time home sharers, which would earn around $6,200 each, yearly. -->
<!-- - By restricting the number of STAs in the County, 300 licenses would need to be allocated to maintain 2019 STA activity levels, with revenues being shared by a small amount of commercial operators. -->
<!-- - Rent subsidies to encourage owners to keep their unit on the long-term rental market in Prince Edward County would likely not be a potential solutions, since rent supplements would need to be as high as $2,520 in Wellington and $2,360 in the townships. -->
