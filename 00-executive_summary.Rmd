<!-- **PATHWAYS TO REINSTATING SHORT-TERM RENTAL ACCOMODATION REGULATIONS** -->

<!-- - Rent subsidies to encourage owners to keep their unit on the long-term rental market in Prince Edward County would likely not be a potential solutions, since rent supplements would need to be as high as $2,520 in Wellington and $2,360 in the townships. -->
